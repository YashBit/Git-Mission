“You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great - and that’s what being a spacefaring civilization is all about. It’s about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars. Building on the knowledge of our ancestors we need to get out there and establish what will become the next step of our civilization. Mine minerals and advance technology in a manner not possible on Earth. Earth binds us, it limits our potential. Just like seafarers who went beyond and accumulated more knowledge. Such will be the reality of the human being.”
