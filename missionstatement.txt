“You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great - and that’s what being a spacefaring civilization is all about. It’s about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars. Why do we want to go beyond? To fulfill our purpose as a species and build upon our very nature of existence as humans. We are meant to discover, we are meant to push the limits of our understanding. We are meant to discover the knowledge kept from us.”
-Elon Musk
